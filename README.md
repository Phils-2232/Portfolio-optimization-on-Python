# Portfolio-optimization-on-Python
This project implements mean-variance portfolio optimization using Python. I did this to optimize the portfolio my team had in the 2025 UK trading competition. It estimates expected returns and the covariance matrix of asset returns,  constructs the efficient frontier, and solves the optimization problem  using convex optimization techniques.
